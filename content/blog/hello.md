Welcome to my blog! It was built with `elm-pages`!

My name is Eric. I am currently working as a fullstack engineer with most of my experience and passion being on the front end. I am heavily influenced by functional programming and strong static type systems. Though I do love the speed and rapid dev cycle that dynamic language enable.

I really enjoy building tools that are helpful and impactful for people, whether it's a web app, cli, or a restful server to interact with. Across the stack I really enjoy trying to improve code base architecture and writing libraries to help make writing other code easier and more maintainable.

I am starting this blog as an excuse to write more Elm code, but beyond that as a way to tell my journey, explore ideas, and show off some cool things I happen to be working on.
